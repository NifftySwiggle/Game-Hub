## 🗂 Project Layout (Conceptual Overview)

This repo is structured for clarity and contribution, but **source logic and critical assets remain protected**.


> Each game folder contains a frontend shell or demo interface. Core logic, assets, and source mechanics are obscured or embedded intentionally.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Love modular systems? Want to help improve an interface or polish a demo? Contributions are welcome—but this is a curated space, not an open remix playground.

You are welcome to:
- Submit ideas, fixes, UX improvements, or frontend tweaks
- Propose new interfaces or demo expansions
- File issues or discussions for feature requests

You are **not permitted to**:
- Reuse or redistribute game code or assets externally
- Remix logic for commercial or derivative works without approval

Forking for exploration is cool. Copy-pasting for reuse? Not so much.

## 🔒 Licensing & Protection

This repository is released with a **custom protective license**:
- You may **explore, contribute, and interact** with demo content
- You **may not reuse, republish, or redistribute** original assets or logic
- Ask before using any component for external projects

All content is owned and maintained by the creator. When in doubt, open a discussion!
